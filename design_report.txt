CS564 PP3 Design Report

As the time needed and overall difficulty of this project was underestimated by our team, we were unable 
to fully implement our entire design. We decided to focus on the functions that seemed obtainable to 
complete before the deadline. The functions that we were able to implement are the constructor, the 
deconstructor, startScan, and endScan, along with a helper function getNextEntry for startScan. For 
insertEntry and scanNext, we included a description in this report of our plans for these functions had we 
alloted enough time, along with details about the functions that we were able to implement.  

Functions implemented:

	Constructor

		The constructor serves multiple purposes. First of all the name of the index file is computed
		using the code given in the write up. Next, we use the index file name to check if this index file
		already exists, and if it does not, we create a new file with that index file name. Also, various
		class members are initialized, some depending on whether a new file has been created. For example,
		if the file exists, we set the header page number to match the existing, otherwise, those pages are 
		allocated using the buffer manager. After this step, we make sure to unpin the header and root pages
		in the buffer manager, as they are no longer needed in memory. Last, we make use of the FileScan 
		class to make entries into our index, using the code from main.cpp lines 113-128, had we implemented 
		the insertEntry function.

	Deconstructor
	
		In the deconstructor, the scanExecuting variable is set to false, index file is written by calling
		the buffer manager flush function, and last the BlobFile object is deleted.

	startScan

		In this function, we first make sure that a scan is not already being executed, and if that is the
		case, the endScan function is called to end that scan. Next, we make sure that the proper operators
		are given for lowOpParm and highOpParm. If anything besides GT or GTE is given for lowOpParm, or
		LT or LTE for the highOpParm, a BadOpCodesException is thrown. We then perform a check to make sure
		that the lowValParm is less than the highValParm, if not, a BadScanrangeException is thrown. Now,
		if all of the parameters given are valid, the scanExecuting member is set to true, the lowValInt,
		highValInt, lowOp, and highOp class members are set to the respective parameters. Last, the helper
		function getNextEntry is called to retrieve the next entry to be scanned.

	endScan
		
		To end a scan, we first check if the scanExecuting class member is set to true, and if not, a
		ScanNotInitialzedException is thrown. Next, we unpin the page that the class member currentPageNum
		is pointing to, as it is not needed in memory anymore. Last, the scanExecuting class member is set
		to false.

	getNextEntry
		
		NEED TO FINISH THIS ONE STILL. THIS FUNCTION NEEDS TO BE REWORKED IN BTREE AS WELL.

Functions not implemented:

	insertEntry
		-Would need functions to split both internal and external nodes
		-Would need functions to insert into internal and external nodes
		-HERE, WE NEED TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE WOULD HAVE DONE.

	scanNext
		-WE NEED TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE WOULD HAVE DONE
